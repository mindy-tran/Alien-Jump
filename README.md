Imagine you are an alien, and after an emergency crash landing onto Earth, you must get back to the mothership to return home.

This game is inspired by the Doodle Jump mobile game that has a player jumping from platforms and getting vertically higher. There will be static platforms, moving platforms, and enemies that try to make your player fall. Unlike the mobile game, there will be 3 different levels with differing environments starting with an underground level, then an above-ground level (icey, rainforest, or other ground terrain), and a level in space. The storyline for the game is based on the idea that an alien has crashed onto Earth and is escaping into space to return home.
